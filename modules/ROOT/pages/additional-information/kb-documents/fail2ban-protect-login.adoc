= Brute Force Protection Against Failed Login Attempts
:toc: right
:description: Implementing a brute force protection against failing login attempts is something that usually should be done before the IDP, the load balancer or whatever component sees the requests first.

== Introduction

{description} Setting up {fail2ban_url}[fail2ban] parsing logs can be a possible way but is subject to a concrete setup. Note that this document gives an overview and assumes that you are fimilar with failed2ban. The content has been extracted and adapted from xref:{oc-central-url}[Central], our community page and is without any claim for correctness and eligability for support, though feedback is welcomed.

== Prerequisites

* Logging to file needs to be enabled for Infinite Scale. See the xref:deployment/services/env-vars-special-scope.adoc#global-environment-variables[OCIS_LOG_FILE] for more details.
* When running a container setup, the Infinite Scale logs need to be available to the host so fail2ban can access them. Make sure to create a volume to do so.
* {fail2ban_url}[fail2ban] needs to be:
** installed and basic setup has been done. 
** able to access the ocis logs.

== Configuration

The log for a failed login attempt looks like this and consists of two consecutive log entries:

[source,plaintext]
----
{"level":"error","service":"idm","bind_dn":"uid=someuser,ou=users,o=libregraph-idm","op":"bind","remote_addr":"127.0.0.1:59672","time":"2023-03-20T19:26:04.726564978Z","message":"invalid credentials"}

{"level":"info","service":"proxy","proto":"HTTP/1.0","request-id":"blabla","remote-addr":"123.123.123.123","method":"POST","status":204,"path":"/signin/v1/identifier/_/logon","duration":135.139963,"bytes":0,"time":"2023-03-20T19:26:04.727076622Z","message":"access-log"}
----

Note that the IP address of the source (`123.123.123.123`) is not in the line where the failed login attempt (`invalid credentials`) is detected.

=== Fail2ban Setup

Note to adapt the paths to configuration files according the environment used.

* Create a fail2ban *filter* file `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ocis.conf` with the following example content:
+
[source,plaintext]
----
# ocis.conf
[Definition]
failregex = ^.*"service":"idm".*"message":"invalid credentials"((.|\n)*)remote-addr"."<HOST>","method":"POST","status":204.*

ignoreregex =

datepattern = ^%%Y-%%b-%%dT%%H:%%M:%%S\.*Z

[Init]
# maybe to be increased, in case some other log slips in between
maxlines = 2
----

* Create a fail2ban *jail* file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ocis.conf` with the following example content, use the correct path to access the `ocis.log` file and change any settings according your needs:
+
[source,plaintext]
----
[ocis]
enabled = true
filter = ocis
logpath = /path/to/ocis/logs/ocis.logs
maxretry = 3
findtime = 3600
bantime = 60
action = iptables-allports
----

Post creating the necessary files, restart fail2ban and test the setup.
