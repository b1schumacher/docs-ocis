= values.yaml Description

== Chart Version: {helm_tab_1_tab_text}

////
Note that this page is created because when the contents of the included table is big, the tab size would be too high and not comfortable to read.

The source content comes from github.

If there are xref's, these are resolved via an attribute defined in antora.yml

This is an adoc table that gets included, not a yaml file.
