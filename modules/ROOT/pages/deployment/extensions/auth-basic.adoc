= Auth Basic Extension Configuration
:toc: right

:description: The oCIS Auth Basic extension provides basic authentication for those clients who cannot handle OIDC. This are rare cases and is usually not necessary.

== Introduction

{description}

// based on a chat with the dev team (willy, ralf). usecase would be to access via macos/finder via webdav folders on oics, or any client that cannot handle oidc.

To enable `auth-basic`, you first must set `PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH` to `true`.

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed
