= The ocis init Command
:toc: right
:description: When setting up Infinite Scale, the ocis init command can be used for basic configuration but is not suitable for all environments. This document describes the details. 

== Introduction

{description}

== When to Use

In general, the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#initialize-infinite-scale[ocis init] command initializes ocis _for the first run_ and creates an `ocis.yaml` configuration file. See xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#configuration-rules[Configuration Rules] for the file location. This command is helpful if you do not provide the necessary settings manually, but some rules apply.

* When using the xref:deployment/binary/binary-setup.adoc[Binary Setup], the command *is recommended* to be run manually once before first usage, though you can also fully configure the initial setup manually.

When running `ocis init`, a random admin password will be printed to the shell for first login. Though the password can be changed afterwards in the UI, it is possible to define it right from the start when initializing:

[source,bash]
----
IDM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
ocis init
----
--

* When using the xref:deployment/container/container-setup.adoc[Container Setup], the command *runs automatically* when starting the container and no configuration file can be found. It skips the initialization step if an `ocis.yaml` config file was found.

* When using xref:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc[Container Orchestration] like with Docker Compose or Kubernetes with Helm Charts, the `ocis init` command *MUST NOT* be used and all configuration parameters must be handed over either via environment variables and/or via the Helm Chart / yaml files. Use the provided Helm Charts as your configuration base and adjust for Docker Compose as needed.

== When Not to Use

Whenever there is a change in the existing configuration, independent of whether `ocis init` was run before, `ocis init` will:

* *fail* if it finds an existing `ocis.yaml` file.
* *not update* any existing configuration.
* overwrite an existing configuration when using the `--force-overwrite` command option - *which is intended for developers only*. For details see the xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#initialize-infinite-scale[ocis init] command.

== How to Apply Changes

* If changes are necessary after running `ocis init`, these changes must be applied via environment variables and/or yaml files to take effect.

* To see which configurations are available, see the xref:deployment/services/services.adoc[services] descriptions.
