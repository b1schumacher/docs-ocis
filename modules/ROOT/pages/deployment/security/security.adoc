== Delete Demo Users

Infinite Scale offers to install demo users for our customers to play around with before they start a serious rollout:

[source,plaintext]
----
+----------+---------------+----------------------+-------+
| username | password      | email                | role  |
+----------+---------------+----------------------+------ +
| einstein | relativity    | einstein@example.org | user  |
| marie    | radioactivity | marie@example.org    | user  |
| moss     | vista         | moss@example.org     | admin |
| richard  | superfluidity | richard@example.org  | user  |
+----------+---------------+----------------------+-------+
----

On a production system, these demo users should go.

TIP: The generation of demo users only happens if run the initial setup with an additional environment variable: `IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true`, see xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#default-users-and-groups[Default Users and Groups]. If you don't use this variable, only the user Admin is created plus internal necessary users.
