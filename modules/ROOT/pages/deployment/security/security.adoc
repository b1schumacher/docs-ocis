= Securing Infinite Scale
:toc: right
:description: As with any system accessible via the web, Infinite Scale also needs to be secured via classical methods on the front-end side. You know best what's necessary for your environment. However, demo users which can be created on initialization should definitely be removed before going into production.

== Introduction

{description}

== Delete Demo Users

Infinite Scale can be initialized with demo users for our customers to play around before you start a serious rollout. These demo users should be deleted post testing for security reasons.

NOTE: The generation of demo users only happens if you run the initial setup (`ocis init`) with an additional environment variable: `IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true`. For more information see xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#default-users-and-groups[Default Users and Groups]. If you don't use this variable, only the user Admin is created.

The demo users which are listed below can be deleted via the webUI.
