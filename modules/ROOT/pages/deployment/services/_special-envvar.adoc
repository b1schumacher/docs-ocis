////
special envvar are maintained manually as they cant be gathered by a automated process in the ocis repo.
these envvars are rarely changed
when a new ocis version is set, we only need to change the reference (tag) at the caller but not the content
when a content is created, we can fix this here and in env-vars-special-scope.adoc
