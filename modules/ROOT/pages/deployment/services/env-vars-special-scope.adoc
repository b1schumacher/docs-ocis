= Environment Variables with Special Scopes
:toc: right

// there is only an adoc table to include but no yaml file. this is only when using special scope envvars.
:no_yaml: true

:description: Some environment variables have an extended or global scope. Variables with extended scope do not directly configure services but functions underneath. Variables with a global scope can configure more than one service.

== Introduction

{description}

Examples:

* The global environment variable `OCIS_LOG_LEVEL` is available in multiple services.
* The extended environment variable `OCIS_CONFIG_DIR` can be used with `ocis init`.

== Extended Environment Variables

// note that if a description of an extended envvar is missing, you need to fix this in:
// https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/master/docs/helpers/extended_vars.yaml
// see the readme.md file in that folder
