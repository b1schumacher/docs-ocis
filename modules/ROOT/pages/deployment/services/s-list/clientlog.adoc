{description}

== Default Values

* The clientlog service listens on port 9260 by default.

include::partial$deployment/services/log-service-ecosystem.adoc[]

== Clientlog Events

The messages the `clientlog` service sends are intended for use by clients, _not by users_. The client might for example be informed that a file has finished post-processing. With that, the client can make the file available to the user without additional server queries.
