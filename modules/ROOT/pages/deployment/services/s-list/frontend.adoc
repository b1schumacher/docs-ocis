:description: The frontend service translates various ownCloud-related HTTP APIs to CS3 requests.

:service_name: frontend

== Introduction

{description}

== Default Values

* Frontend listens on port 9140 by default.

== Endpoints Overview

Currently, the frontend service handles requests for three functionalities, which are

* xref:appprovider[appprovider], 
* xref:archiver[archiver], 
* xref:datagateway[datagateway] and 
* xref:ocs[ocs].

=== appprovider

The appprovider endpoint, by default `/app`, forwards HTTP requests to the CS3 https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.app.registry.v1beta1.RegistryAPI[App Registry API].

=== archiver

The archiver endpoint, by default `/archiver`, implements zip and tar download for collections of files. It will internally use the CS3 API to initiate downloads and then stream the individual files as part of a compressed file.

=== datagateway

The datagateway endpoint, by default `/data`, forwards file up- and download requests to the correct CS3 data provider. OCIS starts a dataprovider as part of the storage-* services. The routing happens based on the JWT that was created by a storage provider in response to an `InitiateFileDownload` or `InitiateFileUpload` request.

=== ocs

The ocs endpoint, by default `/ocs`, implements the ownCloud 10 Open Collaboration Services API by translating it into CS3 API requests. It can handle users, groups, capabilities and also implements the file sharing functionality on top of CS3. The `/ocs/v[12].php/cloud/user/signing-key` is currently handled by the dedicated xref:{s-path}/ocs.adoc[ocs] service.

=== Sharing

Aggregating share information is one of the most time consuming operations in OCIS. The service fetches a list of either received or created shares and has to stat every resource individually. While stats are fast, the default behavior scales linearly with the number of shares.

To save network trips the sharing implementation can cache the stat requests with an in memory cache or in redis. It will shorten the response time by the network round-trip overhead at the cost of the API only eventually being updated.

Setting `FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_TTL=60` would cache the stat info for 60 seconds. Increasing this value makes sense for large deployments with thousands of active users that keep the cache up to date. Low frequency usage scenarios should not expect a noticeable improvement.

== Scalability

While the frontend service does not persist any data, it does cache information about files and filesystem (`Stat()`) responses and user information. Therefore, multiple instances of this service can be spawned in a bigger deployment like when using container orchestration with Kubernetes, when configuring `FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_STORE` and the related config options.

== Define Read-Only Attributes

A lot of user management is done via the standardized LibreGraph API. Depending on how the system is configured, there might be some user attributes that an Infinite Scale instance admin can't change because of properties coming from an external LDAP server, or similar. This can be the case when the Infinite Scale admin is not the LDAP admin. To make life easier for admins, read-only attributes can be displayed differently, e.g. grayed out. To configure these hints for the frontend, use the environment variable `FRONTEND_READONLY_USER_ATTRIBUTES`, which takes a comma separated list of attributes. See the environment variable for supported values.

== Caching

The `frontend` service can use a configured store via `FRONTEND_OCS_STAT_CACHE_STORE`. Possible stores are:

include::partial$multi-location/caching-list.adoc[]
// you must not have one or more blank lines here as it breaks continuous numbering!
. When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `FRONTEND_OCS_STAT_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.
