include::partial$multi-location/caching-list.adoc[]
// you must not have one or more blank lines here as it breaks continuous numbering!
. When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `GATEWAY_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.
