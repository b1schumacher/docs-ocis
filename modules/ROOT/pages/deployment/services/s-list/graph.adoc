:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale Graph service provides a simple graph world API which can be used by clients or other services or extensions.

:ext_name: graph

== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Manual Filters

Using the API, you can manually filter like for users. See the https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/users/ListUsers[Libre Graph API] for examples in the https://owncloud.dev[developer documentation]. Note that you can use `and` to refine results.

== Sequence Diagram

The following image gives an overview of the scenario when a client requests to list available spaces the user has access to. To do so, the client is directed with his request automatically via the proxy service to the graph service.
