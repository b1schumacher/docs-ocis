= IDP Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale IDP service provides a builtin minimal OpenID Connect provider.

:ext_name: idp

== Introduction

{description}

The IPD service is mainly targeted for smaller installations. The recommandation for larger setups is to replace IDP with and external OpenID Connect Provider. See the xref:deployment/container/orchestration/orchestration.adoc#docker-compose-examples[Docker Compose Examples] (ocis_keycloak) for more details.

By default, the IDP service is configured to use the infinite Scale xref:{s-path}/idm.adoc[IDM service] as its LDAP backend for looking up and authenticating users. Other backends like an external LDAP server can be configured via a set of enviroment variables, for details see below.
