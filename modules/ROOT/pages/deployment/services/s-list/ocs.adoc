= OCS Service Configuration
:toc: right
:description: The Infinite Scale OCS service provides the OCS API which is required by some ownCloud clients.

:ext_name: ocs

== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Default Values

* OCS listens on port 9110 by default.

== Caching

The `ocs` service can use a configured store via `GRAPH_STORE_TYPE`. Possible stores are:

[width=100%,cols="25%,85%",options=header]
|===
| Store Type
| Description

| `memory`
| Basic in-memory store and the default.

| `ocmem`
| Advanced in-memory store allowing max size.

| `Redis`
| Stores data in a configured Redis cluster.

| `redis-sentinel`
| Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster.

| `etcd`
| Stores data in a configured etcd cluster.

| `nats-js`
| Stores data using the key-value-store feature of https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/key-value-store[NATS JetStream].

| `noop`
| Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments.
|===

1. Note that in-memory stores are by nature not reboot-persistent.
2. Though usually not necessary, a database name and a database table can be configured for event stores if the event store supports this. Generally, this does not apply to stores of type `in-memory`. These settings are blank by default which means that the standard settings of the configured store apply.
3. The `ocs` service can be scaled if it's not using `in-memory` stores and the stores are configured identically over all instances.
4.  When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `OCS_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `<sentinel-host>:<sentinel-port>/<redis-master>` like `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.
