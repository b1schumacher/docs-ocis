== Introduction

{description}

// fixme: source description is still missing, and a better description is needed

== Default Values

* Storage-Users listens on port 9157 by default.

== Manage Unfinished Uploads

When using Infinite Scale as user storage, a directory named `storage/users/uploads` can be found in the Infinite Scale data folder. This is an intermediate directory based on {tus-url}[TUS] which is an open protocol for resumable uploads. Each upload consists of a _blob_ and a _blob.info_ file. Note that the term _blob_ is just a placeholder.

* **If an upload succeeds**, the _blob_ file will be moved to the target and the _blob.info_ file will be deleted.

* **In case of incomplete uploads**, the _blob_ and _blob.info_ files will continue to recieve data until either the upload succeeds in time or the upload expires based on the `STORAGE_USERS_UPLOAD_EXPIRATION` variable, see the table below for details.

* **In case of expired uploads**, the _blob_ and _blob.info_ files will _not_ be removed automatically. Thus a lot of data can pile up over time wasting storage space.

* **In the rare case of a failure**, after the upload succeeded but the file was not moved to its target location, which can happen when postprocessing fails, the situation is the same as with expired uploads.

Example cases for expired uploads::
* When a user uploads a big file but the file exceeds the user-quota, the upload can't be moved to the target after it has finished. The file stays at the upload location until it is manually cleared.
* If the bandwith is limited and the file to transfer can't be transferred completely before the upload expiration time is reached, the file expires and can't be processed. 

There are two commands available to manage unfinished uploads::
[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users uploads <command>
----

[source,plaintext]
----
COMMANDS:
   list     Print a list of all incomplete uploads
   clean    Clean up leftovers from expired uploads
----

== Purge Expired Space Trash-Bin Items

// referencing: https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/5500

This command is about purging old trash-bin items of `project` spaces (spaces that have been created manually) and `personal` spaces.

[source,bash]
----
ocis storage-users trash-bin <command>
----

[source,plaintext]
----
COMMANDS:
   purge-expired     Purge all expired items from the trashbin
----

The configuration for the `purge-expired` command is done by using the following environment variables.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_USER_ID` is used to obtain space trash-bin information and takes the system admin user as the default which is the `OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID` but can be set individually. It should be noted, that the `OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID` is only assigned automatically when using the single binary deployment and must be manually assigned in all other deployments. The command only considers spaces to which the assigned user has access and delete permission.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PERSONAL_DELETE_BEFORE` has a default value of `30 days`, which means the command will delete all files older than `30 days`. The value is human-readable, valid values are `24h`, `60m`, `60s` etc. `0` is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of `personal space` trash-bin files.

* `STORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PROJECT_DELETE_BEFORE` has a default value of `30 days`, which means the command will delete all files older than `30 days`. The value is human-readable, valid values are `24h`, `60m`, `60s` etc. `0` is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of `project space` trash-bin files.

== Caching

The `storage-users` service caches stat and metadata via the configured store in `STORAGE_USERS_STAT_CACHE_STORE` and `STORAGE_USERS_FILEMETADATA_CACHE_STORE`. Possible stores are:

include::partial$multi-location/caching-list.adoc[]
// you must not have one or more blank lines here as it breaks continuous numbering!
.  When using `redis-sentinel`, the Redis master to use is configured via `STORAGE_USERS_STAT_CACHE_STORE_NODES` and `STORAGE_USERS_FILEMETADATA_CACHE_STORE_NODES` in the form of `10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster`.

== Deprecated Metadata Backend

Starting with Infinite Scale version 3.0.0, the default backend for metadata switched to messagepack. If the setting `STORAGE_USERS_OCIS_METADATA_BACKEND` has not been defined manually, the backend will be migrated to `messagepack` automatically. Though still possible to manually configure `xattrs`, this setting should not be used anymore as it will be removed in a later version.
