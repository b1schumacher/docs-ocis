:description: The web service embeds and serves the static files for the Infinite Scale Web Client.

:ext_name: web

== Introduction

{description} See the xref:{latest-webui-version}@webui:owncloud_web:index.adoc[ownCloud Web] description for more details.

Note that clients will respond with a connection error if the web service is not available.

The web service also provides a minimal API for branding functionality like changing the logo shown.

== Default Values

* Web listens on port 9100 by default.

== Custom Compiled Web Assets

If you want to use your custom compiled web client assets instead of the embedded ones, then you can do that by setting the `WEB_ASSET_PATH` variable to point to your compiled files. See https://owncloud.dev/clients/web/getting-started/[ownCloud Web / Getting Started] and https://owncloud.dev/clients/web/backend-ocis/[ownCloud Web / Setup with oCIS] in the developer documentation for more details.
