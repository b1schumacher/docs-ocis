:toc: macro

:description: The Infinite Scale platform consists of microservices interconnecting with each other. Each service performs a particular task and can be configured independently. Services started with the runtime share the runtime management while services running outside the runtime are managed on their own but connect to each other when necessary.

== Introduction

{description}

For more details see xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#managing-services[Managing Services].

There are descriptions and configuration details for each service available.

== General Information

Multiple environment variables for the same purpose::
+
[TIP]
====
You may see in the tables describing the environment variables that there are two environment variables in the same row configuring the same task. In such a case, the following rule applies:

* The first environment variable is used on a global scale. If set, it will be used in all services where applicable.
* The second environment variable overwrites the first one, but ONLY for the one particular service.

Taking the `webdav` service as an example, you want to set the `OCIS_URL` as a generic value, but for webdav, you want to use a different URL defined with `OCIS_PUBLIC_URL`.
====

Service name vs. environment variable name::
+
[TIP]
====
Environment variable names are always upper case and words are connected with an underscore. They start with the name of the service. If the service name is more than one word and the words are connected with a dash, the dash is replaced by an underscore. This info is useful when you search for environment variables based on the service name.

Example: `auth-basic` -> `AUTH_BASIC_XXX`
====

Default values containing curly brackets::
+
[TIP]
====
In the table showing the variables of a service, the _Default Value_ cell can sometimes contain values with curly brackets like `{{.Id.OpaqueId}}`. These are valid defaults.
====
