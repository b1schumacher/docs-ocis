:description: This document describes how concurrencies are handled with go/Infinite Scale, how this impacts instantiation of services and how configuration of a service works.

== Introduction

{description}

== Instantiation of Services

Services get connected by a user or process. Due to the nature of 
image:deployment/services/go_logo_blue.svg[width=40], the programming language used for Infinite Scale, each connection will create a thread which will be terminated when the connection ends. This means that as long as you have sufficient resources regarding CPU and memory, there will be as many threads created by services as necessary and terminated accordingly. All services started on the server share the same resource pool.

In the image below, the services used are just examples. It could be one service or many services running concurrently. The image illustrates the following: 

* As long as you have resources available, the running service will create and terminate threads automatically.
* There is no need to instantiate a service on the same server to balance load.
* If you increase the resource pool on the server, you can:
** have more connections for existing services,
** run additional but *different* services.
* If the resource pool reaches its limits, you can create additional instances of services on a *different* server.
* There are only a few exceptions like storage connectors as they will have a different configuration for each type of storage.

These statements are true when using the runtime as well as when running services independent of the runtime.

== Runtime Services

* With the command `ocis server`, all services are started with the runtime and share the same PID. If you do not want to start all services available, you have two choices, both using envirnment variables, useful if you want to try starting a set of services outside the runtime, e.g. when testing orchestration:
** With `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES` you define all services you _want to start_ and leave out all you dont want to start:
+
[source,bash]
----
OCIS_RUN_SERVICES=settings,storage-system, \
    graph,graph-explorer,idp,ocs,store,thumbnails, \
    web,webdav,frontend,gateway,users, groups, \
    auth-basic,auth-bearer,storage-authmachine, \
    storage-users,storage-shares,storage-publiclink, \
    app-provider,sharing,proxy,ocdav \
    ocis server
----
** With `OCIS_EXCLUDE_RUN_SERVICES` you define all services you _do not want_ to start, out of all available services which would normally be started:
+
[source,bash]
----
OCIS_EXCLUDE_RUN_SERVICES=auth-basic,storage-publiclink \
    ocis server
----
+
NOTE: This environment variable has no effect when `OCIS_RUN_SERVICES` is set, only one cn abe used.

* Runtime services rules
** You cannot instantiate a runtime service
** All runtime services are a part of the `ocis server` process and therefore share the same process ID (PID).
** Runtime services share the same PID while non-runtime services have their own PID.

== Configuration Rules

Note that in the examples described, only the webdav service is used, but the process is valid for all services available.

Example::
You start the Infinite Scale runtime with `ocis server`.
+
--
. The configuration file `/etc/ocis/ocis.yaml` is read.
. The configuration file `/etc/ocis/webdav.yaml` is read AND applied.
. The environment variables are read and applied. These can overwrite already existing configuration elements. See section xref:deployment/general/general-info.adoc#configuration-rules[Configuration Rules] about the order in which different configurations get applied (config arithmetics).
--
+
All services have started, share the same PID and have a defined config. Typing `ocis list` shows all active runtime services.

This image gives you a graphical representation of the rule set described above.
