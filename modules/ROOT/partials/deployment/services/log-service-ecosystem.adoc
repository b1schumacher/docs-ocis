| xref:{s-path}/activitylog.adoc[activitylog] ^1^
| This service *stores events per resource*. These can be retrieved to show item activities.

| xref:{s-path}/clientlog.adoc[clientlog]
| This service *composes machine-readable messages*, so clients can act without the need to query the server.

| xref:{s-path}/eventhistory.adoc[eventhistory]
| This service *stores events* and allows other services to retrieve them via an event ID.

| xref:{s-path}/sse.adoc[sse]
| This service is only responsible for *sending these messages*. It does not care about their form or language.

| xref:{s-path}/userlog.adoc[userlog] ^2^
| This service *translates and adjusts messages* to be human-readable.

Services may depend on each other:

1. The `activitylog` service requires the `eventhistory` service. +
2. The `userlog` service is configured by default to use both the `eventhistory` and `sse` service. It can be configured to use both, the one, or the other.
