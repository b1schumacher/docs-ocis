NOTE: If you want to reuse an already configured _minimized_ setup for any other address than `\https://localhost`, you *must* use a reverse proxy. When Infinite Scale is accessed, it forwards requests to the embedded xref:{s-path}/idp.adoc[IDP service] which requires a secure connection. See the xref:depl-examples/bare-metal.adoc[Bare Metal Deployment with systemd] for more details on using a reverse proxy setup.
